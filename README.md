#React-TS with data fetching Demo
A simple demo app combining react js with typescript's type safe capabilities in order to catch most type related bugs during live coding rather than runtime.

#Install and Run
Once you download the files and open the project in any editor of your liking, you can run
$ npm install 
and then 
$ npm run dev
in your terminal (given that you have npm installed in your system).
